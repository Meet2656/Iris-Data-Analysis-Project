# Iris-Data-Analysis-Project
This repository contains a simple data analysis project using the Iris dataset. We performed a quick exploration and created a visualization to understand the data using python.

## Project Steps

1. Loading the Dataset: We loaded the Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

2. Data Summary: We used pandas to generate summary statistics of the dataset.

3. Visualization: We created a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between sepal length and sepal width.

## Visualization
Below is the scatter plot we generated:
